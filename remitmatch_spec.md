# RemitMatch - Functional Specification

## Purpose

RemitMatch is a web application that streamlines the reconciliation of remittance advice PDFs (or other formats)with invoice data from accounting software. It reduces manual data entry by extracting invoice/payment details from remittance documents and matching them against accounting records.

---

## Core Problem

Companies receive remittance advices (usually PDFs), often covering multiple invoices. Matching these to invoices in accounting software (e.g., Xero) is usually manual and time-consuming.

---

## MVP Features

### Functional Overview

1. **Authentication**

- OAuth login via Xero
- Standard login/register

2. **Organisation Setup** 

**‚úÖ Confirmed Behavior**: Users land on "Connect to Xero" screen immediately upon signup.

- Upon successful connection, the organisation is created using the organisation name from Xero.
- **‚úÖ Confirmed**: Organisation and tenant information is stored in Supabase database.
- The system checks for existing organisations with the same Xero tenant ID to avoid duplication.
- If an organisation with that Xero account already exists, the user is shown a message: "This organisation is already registered in RemitMatch."
- The user is given the option to send an access request email to the primary contact of the organisation.
- A new role type, **Organisation Owner**, is introduced. This user is the primary contact for the organisation and receives administrative notifications, including:
  - Access requests
  - Billing notices
  - System-wide alerts (e.g. data export or deletion requests)
- Select which bank accounts to include in RemitMatch as available to map payments against.
- One of these will be marked as the default account for payment mapping

**Session Metadata Storage**: After successful connection, the following metadata is stored in the client session (as defined in Client Session Model section):
- user_id, user_email, user_display_name
- organisation_id, organisation_name  
- role, subscription_tier
- org_membership_ids (for organisation switching)

3. **Remittance Management**

**‚úÖ Confirmed Upload Flow**:
- **‚úÖ Confirmed**: File goes directly to Supabase Storage upon upload
- **‚úÖ Confirmed**: Supabase Edge Function triggered via `storage.onUpload` event
- **‚úÖ Confirmed**: Edge Function calls backend `processRemittance()` function
- Extract payment data (invoice #s, amounts paid)
- Match data against Xero invoice data
- **‚úÖ Confirmed Manual Override & Approval Flow**:
  - Users can select from a dropdown of all open invoices
  - Users can edit the extracted payment amount per invoice
  - The top-level remittance amount is always the sum of invoice lines and cannot be overridden
  - **‚úÖ Confirmed**: Two buttons available: "Save Manual Changes" and "Save + Approve"
  - **‚úÖ Confirmed**: Backend uses single atomic `approve_remittance()` endpoint
  - **‚úÖ Confirmed**: Optimistic UI updates status locally first, real sync is backgrounded
  - Once a remittance is approved, no further changes can be made (see Unapproval Logic below)
  - Approved remittances are pushed to Xero with a status of 'Unreconciled'
  - Final status is 'Reconciled' once payment is confirmed in Xero
  - Reconciliation status is detected via polling Xero daily at the start of each day
  - **‚úÖ Confirmed**: Global "Refresh" button on remittance list for manual Xero sync
  - **‚úÖ Confirmed**: Per-remittance "Retry" button for AI extraction retry
  - **Each remittance will store a single AI-generated confidence score (not shown in the UI).** This score reflects the overall confidence of the extraction process across the remittance. It is not currently used in the user workflow but may later support features like auto-approval of high-confidence remittances (e.g. >95%). Confidence is stored for internal monitoring and potential future automation only.
- Soft delete behaviour:
  - Users can soft delete a remittance (logically hide it)
  - Deleted remittances are hidden from the UI
  - **Deletion is not allowed** if the remittance is in `All payments matched - Awaiting Approval`, `Exported to Xero - Unreconciled`, or `Exported to Xero - Reconciled` status
    - Users must unapprove first before deletion

4. **Remittance State Machine**

- `Uploaded` ‚Üí `Data Retrieved`
- `Data Retrieved` ‚Üí `All payments matched - Awaiting Approval` / `Error - Payments Unmatched`
- `All payments matched - Awaiting Approval` ‚Üí `Exported to Xero - Unreconciled`
- `Exported to Xero - Unreconciled` ‚Üí `Exported to Xero - Reconciled`
- `Error - Payments Unmatched` ‚Üí `All payments matched - Awaiting Approval` (after manual override)
- `Error - Payments Unmatched` ‚Üí `Data Retrieved` (retry AI extraction)
- Failed Xero export ‚Üí `Export Failed`
- Any status ‚Üí `Soft Deleted` (logical deletion)

5. **Unapproval Logic**

Once a remittance is approved, it enters the status `Exported to Xero - Unreconciled` and a payment is created in Xero.

**Unapproval is allowed under the following conditions:**

- **Who can unapprove:** Any user with role **Admin** or **User**.
- **When:**
  - The remittance is in status `Exported to Xero - Unreconciled`.
  - The corresponding payment in Xero **has not been reconciled**.
  - The payment in Xero **can be successfully deleted** via API.

If these conditions are met:

- The payment is deleted in Xero.
- The remittance reverts to the prior status:
  - `All payments matched - Awaiting Approval` if auto-matched
  - `All payments matched - Awaiting Approval` if manually adjusted
- A new audit log entry is created for the unapproval.

If unapproval is blocked:

- The user is shown a message explaining the reason (e.g. "This payment has already been reconciled in Xero. Please unreconcile the payment in Xero before trying again.")
- No state change occurs in RemitMatch.

**Audit Logging:**

- Every unapproval attempt is logged, including:
  - User ID
  - Timestamp
  - Outcome: `success` or `rejected`
  - Reason if rejected (e.g. "payment already reconciled")

**Sync Monitoring: New Status**

- Add status `Export Failed`: Indicates that the payment in Xero has diverged from the approved remittance (e.g. amount, invoice mapping, or deletion).
- This is triggered via webhook or periodic sync check.
- Remittance is flagged for review.
- Blocks further approval/unapproval until resolved or reset.

6. **Chart of Accounts Integration**

- Import bank accounts from Xero
- Select default payment account per organisation
- Allow overrides per remittance

7. **Organisation & User Management**

- Users belong to organisations - which are the primary organising structure of the app
- Users can belong to multiple organisations
- Organisation invites via email
- Allow switching between organisations
- While logged in as a user in an organisation, users can add others by entering their email address and selecting a role
- User roles included in MVP:
  - Organisation Owner: full access including billing, user management, unapproval, and receiving administrative emails
  - Admin: full access to app functionality including inviting users and unapproving remittances
  - User: can upload, reconcile, and unapprove remittances, but cannot invite users
  - Auditor: can only view remittance data and audit logs

8. **Client Session Model**

To support a smooth multi-tenancy experience, RemitMatch maintains a persistent client-side session store that includes key context:

- user_id: Current logged-in user
- user_email, user_display_name
- organisation_id, organisation_name
- role: User's role in the active organisation
- subscription_tier: Cached subscription level, used for UI restrictions
- org_membership_ids: Used to support organisation switching

**‚úÖ Confirmed Implementation Strategy**

**‚úÖ Confirmed Zustand Store Shape**:
```typescript
type SessionState = {
  user_id: string;
  user_email: string;
  organisation_id: string;
  organisation_name: string;
  role: "owner" | "admin" | "user" | "auditor";
  subscription_tier: "free" | "business" | "pro" | "max";
  active_remittance_id: string | null;
  org_membership_ids: string[]; // for switching orgs
  setActiveOrganisation: (orgId: string) => void;
};
```

This session context is hydrated after login or org switch and remains in memory for the duration of the session. Recommended options:

- **‚úÖ Confirmed**: Zustand: Lightweight, reactive store for easy cross-component access
- React Context: For simpler apps with fewer dependencies
- React Query: Can be used in combination to manage stale/fresh data control

Session state is used to:

- Gate UI access (e.g. Admin-only actions)
- Determine current organisation context across pages
- Avoid passing data through URL parameters
- **‚úÖ Confirmed**: Track active remittance selection across views

All backend or Supabase calls can leverage this session data to ensure proper authorisation and UX continuity.

**üß† Tab Switch Security Issue**

**‚úÖ Confirmed Security Strategy**: To prevent cross-tab state conflict:

- **‚úÖ Confirmed**: Backend routes must validate the `organisation_id` from session and compare it to what's being acted on
- **‚úÖ Confirmed**: Every `POST /remittance/:id/*` call should verify that the remittance belongs to the active org of the session
- **üõ°Ô∏è Best practice**: All updates go via backend, even if Supabase is used directly for reads

9. **UI Interaction and State Management**

To ensure seamless transitions and accurate updates across screens, RemitMatch uses a shared in-memory state model to persist and propagate remittance data during user interaction.

**Navigation Model**
- UI state (e.g. selected remittance, filters, scroll position) is maintained in memory
- No query parameters or route chaining are used to pass state between views

10. **AI Processing Workflow**

- After a remittance is uploaded, the system calls a single `process_remittance(fileUrl)` function to initiate extraction.
- This function is the entry point for the AI matching process and allows backend logic to be updated without requiring frontend changes.
- Backend could radically change, but this allows maximum swapout.
  - e.g. The AI first approach could be replaced by a function to extract text via OCR, etc.
  - The goal is to allow us to iterate on the backend without impacting the rest of the app.
- For now, the primary method uses OpenAI's Assistant API with a defined system prompt.
- The output must be returned in the expected JSON format, including a `confidence` field:
- WIll likely later implement logic to try a second approach if the confidence is below a threshold.
  - And opitonally allow the user to turn on auto-approving remittances with confidence above a threshold

```json
{
  "Date": "[Date]",
  "TotalAmount": [Total_Amount],
  "PaymentReference": "[Payment_Reference_or_None]",
  "Payments": [
    {
      "InvoiceNo": "[InvoiceNo1]",
      "PaidAmount": [Paid_Amount1]
    }
    {
      "InvoiceNo": "[InvoiceNo2]",
      "PaidAmount": [Paid_Amount2]
    }
  ],
  "confidence": "[% confidence that the correct information has been extracted]"
}
```

- If AI returns default or empty JSON, retry with alternate method
- If extraction fails, the system will automatically queue a retry
- Include 'Retry' button in UI to manually trigger fallback or reprocessing

12. **Audit Log**

- Maintain a full history of all changes made to each remittance
- Log includes:
  - User who made the change
  - Timestamp of change
  - Type of action (e.g. edit, approval, unapproval, sync attempt)
  - Field changed (if applicable)
  - Original value ‚Üí New value (for field-level changes)
  - Outcome (e.g. success, error)
- Include status changes such as:
  - Initial match complete
  - Approved
  - Soft delete (logical removal, not physical)
  - Error states
- All users can view the audit log on each remittance

13. **Xero Sync Failure Handling**

- **Sync Failure Status:**

  - Add a new remittance status `Export Failed`
  - Indicates the attempt to create a payment in Xero was unsuccessful (e.g. API error, validation error, network failure)
  - Remittance remains in `All payments matched - Awaiting Approval` state
  - Display an error message in the remittance detail view
  - Show a badge/tag in the remittance list

- **Retry Strategy:**

  - User can manually retry the sync using a ‚ÄúRetry Xero Export‚Äù button
  - Retry attempts are logged and optionally rate-limited to avoid abuse or repeated failure

- **Audit Trail for Sync Attempts:**

  - Log all sync attempts (success or failure)
  - Record:
    - Timestamp
    - Outcome (success or error)
    - Xero API response (sanitised)
    - User ID if manually triggered

- **User Feedback:**

  - Remittances with sync failures appear in a dedicated summary on the Dashboard
  - Badge appears on remittance in list view to highlight error state

14. **Subscription Management**

- Integrated with Stripe
- Managed at the organisation level
- Users without an active subscription cannot access core features
- Subscription plans (indicative):
  - **Free Tier**: Up to 5 remittances per month
  - **Business**: \$15/month for 30 remittances
  - **Pro**: \$30/month for 120 remittances
  - **Max**: \$50/month for 250 remittances
- Subscription usage is tracked per organisation
- Subscription enforcement includes soft limits with upgrade prompts and hard caps beyond threshold
- Future implementation will include rate-limiting protections to avoid abuse (e.g. upload spam, excessive retries)
- Will need to manage rate limiting to prevent abuse and protect API cost


15. - Auth:
- App to use Email, Google, and Xero OAuth
- auth.users to map to public.profiles through a public.auth_link_table

## Technology Stack & Architecture

### Frontend

- **Framework**: Next.js
- **Hosting**: Vercel
- **State Management**: Zustand (with optional React Context/React Query integration)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth
- **Storage**: Supabase Storage (PDFs and AI outputs)
- **API Communication**: Supabase client (direct) or backend API where appropriate

### Backend

- **Framework**: FastAPI (Python)
- **Hosting**: Render.com
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Xero API polling (daily syncs, scheduled jobs)
  - AI remittance processing (OpenAI Assistant API)
  - Validation and sync logic (approval, unapproval, reconciliation)
  - Secure interaction with Supabase
  - **Scheduled Tasks**: Daily background job at 3:00 AM to extract invoice details from connected accounting software (Xero) for all organisations
- **‚úÖ Confirmed API Endpoints**:
  - `processRemittance()` - Called by Supabase Edge Function
  - `approve_remittance()` - Atomic approval operation
  - `/dashboard/summary` - Single endpoint returning all dashboard counts

**üß© API Structure & Routing**

**‚úÖ Confirmed Read/Write Split**:

**üîÅ Read / Supabase (client-safe)**:
These fetch data directly via React Query:

- `GET /remittances` (list view, filters, pagination)
- `GET /remittance/:id` (detail view)
- `GET /dashboard/summary`

**‚öôÔ∏è Write / Backend**:
All modifying actions are routed through backend for:
- Multi-tenant validation
- Security
- Cross-service logic (e.g., Xero integration)

- `POST /remittance/:id/save-overrides`
- `POST /remittance/:id/approve`
- `POST /remittance/:id/unapprove`
- `POST /remittance/:id/retry-ai`
- `POST /xero/sync-all` (manual refresh)

**üîç Error Handling: UX Strategy**

**‚úÖ Confirmed Error Handling Behavior**:

| Scenario | Backend Behaviour | Frontend Status Update |
|----------|------------------|----------------------|
| Export to Xero fails | Return 500, update status to `Export Failed` | Show badge: Export Failed |
| Retry AI fails again | Update status to `Error - Payments Unmatched` | Show badge: Needs Manual Match |
| Manual override saved | Update remittance, recalculate matching, return state | Show badge: Saved - Awaiting Approval |
| Xero refresh fails | Return last-known state (fallback), log warning | No visual error shown |

**‚úÖ Confirmed**: All changes to remittance status should be clearly reflected in the table row and persisted to Supabase.

## Session + Organisation Context Handling

This section outlines the strategy for managing user sessions, organisation context, and multi-tenant safety across the RemitMatch application.

### Goals

- Avoid cross-organisation state confusion (especially in multi-tab workflows)
- Ensure all backend operations are performed within an authorised, validated organisation context
- Prevent issues like approving a remittance in Org A while viewing Org B

### Client Session Model (Frontend)

Implemented using Zustand. The in-memory shape:

```typescript
{
  user_id: string;
  organisation_id: string;
  role: "owner" | "admin" | "user" | "auditor";
  subscription_tier: string;
  active_remittance_id: string | null;
}
```

**Initialisation**
- Hydrated on app load from `/me` endpoint
- React hook (`useSessionStore`) reads and sets the session

### Cross-tab Handling

- Use storage event listener on `localStorage` to detect `active_organisation` change
- Prompt reload or rehydrate session on mismatch

### Organisation Display in UI

- A persistent, visible indicator of the current active organisation must be shown in the application (e.g. in the sidebar header, as shown in UI designs)
- Must update immediately if the user changes organisation

### Backend Auth + Org Context

Every protected route must validate the user's active organisation explicitly:

**Example: Approve Remittance**

```
POST /api/remittance/:id/approve
{
  organisation_id: "org_123"
}
```

**Validation Logic**

```typescript
const user = await getCurrentUserFromToken(req)

if (!userHasAccessToOrg(user.id, req.body.organisation_id)) {
  return res.status(403).json({ error: "Access denied to organisation" })
}

const remittance = await db.remittances.findById(req.params.id)
if (remittance.organisation_id !== req.body.organisation_id) {
  return res.status(403).json({ error: "Remittance does not belong to organisation" })
}
```

### Centralised Org Validation Utility (Backend)

```typescript
export async function assertValidOrgContext(user_id: string, organisation_id: string) {
  const membership = await db.organisation_members.findFirst({
    where: { user_id, organisation_id }
  })

  if (!membership) {
    throw new Error("Invalid organisation context")
  }
}
```

### Remittance Status Lifecycle (Enum)

To standardise remittance handling, statuses are centrally managed as an enum:

```typescript
export type RemittanceStatus =
  | "Uploaded"
  | "Data Retrieved"
  | "All payments matched - Awaiting Approval"
  | "Error - Payments Unmatched"
  | "Exported to Xero - Unreconciled"
  | "Exported to Xero - Reconciled"
  | "Export Failed"
  | "Soft Deleted";
```

These values are used across:

- UI filters
- Table row display
- API status transitions
- Matching logic + retry flags

### Remittance Lines Table

Each remittance line item (representing one invoice from a remittance) tracks both AI-extracted values and optional manual overrides.

```sql
CREATE TABLE remittance_lines (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),

  remittance_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES remittances(id),

  invoice_number TEXT NOT NULL,              -- Extracted from AI
  ai_paid_amount NUMERIC NOT NULL,           -- From AI extraction
  manual_paid_amount NUMERIC,                -- Optional user override

  ai_invoice_id UUID REFERENCES invoices(id),      -- Matched by backend logic
  override_invoice_id UUID REFERENCES invoices(id), -- Set by user manually, if overridden

  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now()
);
```

**Behaviour**

- If `override_invoice_id` is NULL, use `ai_invoice_id`
- If `manual_paid_amount` is NULL, use `ai_paid_amount`
- Enables accurate rollback after unapproving a remittance
- Supports full auditability and visibility into overrides

### Benefits

- Hardens multi-tenant boundaries
- Ensures only authorised users act within scope
- Prevents silent data corruption due to stale tabs or invalid session state
- Supports organisation switching while keeping backend in sync

### Notes

- All writes must include `organisation_id`
- All backend routes should validate session tokens + organisation context
- We may consider also encoding the active `organisation_id` into the JWT in future, for additional validation

### Future Improvements

- Add visual indicator of current organisation in UI (Implemented in MVP ‚Äî see sidebar)
- Persist last selected organisation to localStorage and Supabase profile
- Prevent navigating to pages if user's active org isn't permitted for that resource

---

### Shared Types & Schema Strategy

- **Schema Format**: JSON Schema (stored in `packages/shared/schemas/`)
- **Purpose**: Defines the contract for remittance objects shared across frontend and backend
- **Frontend Use**: TypeScript types generated using `json-schema-to-typescript`
- **Backend Use**: Loaded into FastAPI using `pydantic.create_model_from_json_schema()`
- **Benefit**: Ensures a single source of truth for request/response structures, reducing desynchronisation risk

### Database

- **Platform**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
- **Security**: Row-Level Security (RLS)
- **Usage tracking**: Tracked via backend events and scheduled summaries

### Domains

- Primary domain: `remitmatch.com`
  - `app.remitmatch.com` ‚Üí Frontend (Vercel)
  - `api.remitmatch.com` ‚Üí Backend (Fly.io with FastAPI)

---

## Design System Decisions

- **Styling Framework**: Tailwind CSS (utility-first)
- **Component Library**: shadcn/ui
  - Provides accessible, clean components
  - Fully customisable with Tailwind
- **Dark Mode**: Not included in MVP
- **Design Approach**: Code-first prototyping (no Figma dependency)
- **Typography & Spacing**:
  - No hardcoded values in components or screens
  - Use centralised Tailwind tokens for font sizes, spacing, colours
  - Optionally extract base theme into `packages/ui/theme.ts` for clarity and control

**üé® Design System Integration (Frontend)**

**‚úÖ Confirmed Component Structure**:
All components will use centralised design primitives:

```tsx
<Text size="sm" variant="muted" />
<Button variant="primary" size="md" />
<Badge variant="error" /> // status indicators
```

**‚úÖ Confirmed**: No text sizes, colours, paddings hardcoded into screens.

**‚úÖ Confirmed**: Tailwind + custom theme tokens via a design system layer.

**‚úÖ Confirmed Status Badge Mapping**:
Status ‚Üí badge mapping defined centrally, e.g.:

```typescript
{
  "All payments matched - Awaiting Approval": "info",
  "Exported to Xero - Unreconciled": "success",
  "Exported to Xero - Reconciled": "success", 
  "Export Failed": "error",
  "Error - Payments Unmatched": "warning",
  "Data Retrieved": "info",
  "Uploaded": "info",
  "Soft Deleted": "muted",
}
```

---

## Monorepo Structure

A monorepo is used to unify development across frontend, backend, and shared modules.

### Suggested Folder Layout

```
remitmatch/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ apps/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ web/        # Next.js frontend (Vercel)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ api/        # FastAPI backend (Fly.io)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ packages/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ shared/     # Shared types, constants, schema definitions
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ config/     # Shared ESLint, Prettier, TS config
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .github/        # CI/CD workflows
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ turbo.json      # (if using Turborepo)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
```

### Recommended Tools

- **Turborepo**: For task orchestration and cache
- **pnpm**: Package manager supporting workspaces
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD per app (deploy frontend/backend separately)
- **Docker**: For FastAPI packaging and deployment

---

## Deployment

### Frontend (Vercel)

- Hosted via Vercel‚Äôs optimised platform for Next.js
- Integrated with Supabase client for database access
- Calls backend API only where logic must be secured or async (e.g. Xero export)

### Backend (Render.com)

- Hosts FastAPI app
- Handles scheduled polling (daily invoice status syncs)
- Performs AI processing tasks
- Exposes protected API endpoints
- Can be scaled independently
- **Daily Scheduled Tasks**: 3:00 AM job to sync invoice data from Xero for all organisations

### Domain Setup

- Use `remitmatch.com` as root
  - Subdomain `app.remitmatch.com` for frontend (CNAME to Vercel)
  - Subdomain `api.remitmatch.com` for backend (CNAME to Render.com IP/hostname)
- SSL provided via Vercel and Render.com automatically

---

## Cost Considerations (Startup Phase)

| Component        | Platform        | Est. Monthly Cost (AUD)    |
| ---------------- | --------------- | -------------------------- |
| Frontend         | Vercel Free/Pro | \$0 ‚Äì \$20                 |
| Backend API      | Render.com      | Free ‚Äì \$7                 |
| Database         | Supabase Pro    | \$30 ‚Äì \$70                |
| AI API (OpenAI)  | Usage based     | \~\$0.10‚Äì\$0.30/remittance |
| Stripe/Xero APIs | Free tiers      | \$0                        |
| Domain           | Namecheap       | \~\$15/year                |

This keeps monthly infra costs under \$100 while maintaining flexibility and scalability.

## Planned Features (Post-MVP)

1. **Email Submission of Remittances**

   - Each organisation is assigned a unique upload email address, using `+aliases` or sub-addressing.
   - Users can configure which sender email addresses are allowed to submit remittances via email.
   - Files sent to this address are processed and appear alongside manually uploaded remittances in the same workflow.
   - Audit logs will show the sender email address and timestamp.
   - Failed or unprocessable emails are only surfaced in the UI (no outbound failure email notifications in MVP).

2. **Daily Summary Notifications**

   - Optional email alerts summarising remittance issues per organisation:
     - Unmatched invoices
     - Failed extractions
     - Pending approvals
   - Configurable per user.

## UI Pages

### 1. Dashboard

**‚úÖ Confirmed API Strategy**: Single `/dashboard/summary` endpoint

- Summary view:
  - **‚úÖ Confirmed**: `unmatched_remittances_count` - Remittances with errors or unmatched invoices
  - **‚úÖ Confirmed**: `awaiting_approval_count` - Awaiting approval remittances
  - **‚úÖ Confirmed**: `reconciled_count` - Unreconciled remittances
  - **‚úÖ Confirmed**: `failed_ai_count` - Remittances with processing failures

### 2. Remittances

**‚úÖ Confirmed List View**:
- **‚úÖ Confirmed**: Infinite scroll implementation using React Query
- Columns: Status, Date Added, Payment Date, Payment Amount, Reference, # Invoices
- Filters: Status, Date, etc.
- Controls: Upload, **‚úÖ Confirmed**: Global "Refresh" button for Xero sync

**‚úÖ Confirmed Detail View**:
- **‚úÖ Confirmed**: PDF fetched when remittance is selected
- **‚úÖ Confirmed**: All detail info comes from cached memory data (no additional backend calls)
- PDF viewer (left)
- Payment info (top-right): Status, Date, Amount, Reference
- Invoice mapping table (bottom-right):
  - Extracted Invoice #, Extracted Payment Amount, Extracted Payment Reference
  - Matched Invoice #, Total Invoice Value, Amount Outstanding
  - Manual override dropdowns
  - Diff between extracted and overridden values
  - Link to view audit log for the remittance

### 3. Auth Pages

- Login
- Register (triggers organisation setup if orphaned)

### 4. Organisation Settings

- Integrations: Connect to Xero
- Chart of Accounts: Select default payment account
- Members: Invite/manage users
- Subscription: Manage billing via Stripe

### 5. User Settings

- Placeholder for personal settings

## Navigation

- Sidebar or top navigation (to be confirmed)
- Org switcher for users in multiple organisations
- Main items: Dashboard, Remittances, Organisation Settings, Account Settings

## Primary Use Cases

- Upload and reconcile remittances
- Confirm payments and sync with Xero
- Manage organisations and settings
- Retry extraction logic when needed
- Notify users of reconciliation issues
- Maintain full audit history of remittance activity
- Manage subscriptions at the organisation level

## Tools Recommended for Design

- **Whimsical** ‚Äì for flowcharts, state diagrams, and journey maps
- **Figma** ‚Äì for wireframes and UI mockups

## Supabase Implementation

### Storage Path Structure

Files uploaded to Supabase storage will follow this path structure:

```
/{organisation.id}/{remittance.id}/{file.id or filename.pdf}
```

- Ensures clear hierarchical organisation
- Simplifies access control and cleanup operations
- Supports potential for multiple files per remittance (e.g. multi-page scans, separate images)
- AI-generated output (e.g. JSON) may also be stored alongside PDFs in the same directory

### RLS (Row-Level Security) Strategy

- **Tables:**

  - `organisations`
  - `organisation_members` (`user_id`, `organisation_id`)
  - `remittances` (`id`, `organisation_id`, ...)
  - `files` (`id`, `remittance_id`, `organisation_id`, `path`, ...)

- **RLS Policy Example:**

```sql
USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM organisation_members
    WHERE organisation_id = files.organisation_id
    AND user_id = auth.uid()
  )
)
```

- Users can only access files that belong to organisations they are members of
- File paths must remain immutable and not user-controlled
- Signed URLs can be used for secure file access in the frontend

## Key Risks and Considerations

### AI Extraction Reliability

- Manual override required for non-extractable data
- Ensure overrides are clear, auditable, and limited to invoice-level detail
- Confidence score to be included per extracted item (hidden from user)

### Sync with Xero

- Critical to define a complete failure-handling strategy for sync operations
- Must handle cases like:
  - Duplicate payment entries
  - Already-paid invoices
  - Currency mismatches
- Add conflict resolution flow in future designs

### Security and Abuse Risk

- Potential for someone to submit a remittance and trigger invoice reconciliation without sending payment
- Requires up-to-date reconciliation processes and user diligence
- Dashboard and summary notifications help mitigate this risk

## Business Positioning

RemitMatch operates in the intersection of accounting automation and document intelligence.

**Differentiators:**

- **Simplicity:** Single-purpose, focused tool
- **Accuracy:** Tailored AI extraction
- **Workflow Fit:** Aligned with small business and finance team needs using Xero

**Future Potential:**

- Expansion into invoice reading and general bookkeeping automation (e.g. similar to Lightyear), but not part of MVP
- Continue improving override and approval UX, ensuring traceability and clarity

## Current AI Prompts

### System Prompt

```
You are a remittance advice reader tasked with extracting specific information from a PDF file of a remittance advice and presenting it as a valid JSON object.

After a PDF file is uploaded, automatically trigger the `read_pdf_remittance` function to extract the remittance data and return the JSON output immediately, without requiring any additional user input or submitting.

Extract the following information:

- **Date**: The date of the remittance. Assume dates are in Australian Format: DD/MM/YYYY or YYYY/MM/DD
- **Total Amount**: The total amount paid.
- **Payment Reference**: The reference number for the payment. If no reference is present, use `None`. You will find lots of different names for 'Payment Reference', like 'Reference Code'.
- **Payments**:
  - **InvoiceNo**: The invoice number associated with each payment.
  - **PaidAmount**: The amount paid for each invoice.

# Output Format

- Your response must be a valid JSON object that begins with `{`.
- Do not include any additional headers or text like 'json'.
- Adhere strictly to the following structure:

{
  "Date": "[Date]",
  "TotalAmount": [Total_Amount],
  "PaymentReference": "[Payment_Reference_or_None]",
  "Payments": [
    {
      "InvoiceNo": "[InvoiceNo1]",
      "PaidAmount": [Paid_Amount1]
    },
    {
      "InvoiceNo": "[InvoiceNo2]",
      "PaidAmount": [Paid_Amount2]
    }
    // Continue for as many payments are included
  ],
  "confidence": "[% confidence that the correct information has been extracted]"
}

# Notes

- Ensure all numerical values (such as amounts) are not enclosed in quotes.
- Precise identification of fields in the PDF content is essential for accurate extraction.
- If a Payment Reference is not present in the PDF, include "PaymentReference": null in the JSON output.

After calling the read_pdf_remittance function, don't request a further submit, or additional input. Simply run it and return the JSON.
