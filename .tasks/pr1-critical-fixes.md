## üî¥ MVP BLOCKERS (Must Fix Before Merge)

### 1. Basic Authentication (MVP)
**Priority**: Critical  
**Risk**: Security vulnerability allowing unauthorized payment creation  
**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours  
**MVP Scope**: Basic JWT validation to secure payment endpoints

#### Tasks:
- [x] **1.1 Authentication Strategy (COMPLETED)**
  - ‚úÖ **Decision**: Use JWT token validation with Clerk
  - ‚úÖ **Rationale**: Stateless, secure, no external API dependency

- [x] **1.2 Minimal JWT Middleware**
  - ‚úÖ Created `apps/api/app/middleware/auth.py` with basic ClerkAuth class
  - ‚úÖ Implemented JWT token validation using Clerk's public key (JWKS)
  - ‚úÖ Basic user extraction from JWT payload (user_id, email only)
  - ‚úÖ **Dependencies**: `python-jose[cryptography]`, `httpx`
  
  **MVP Implementation:**
  ```python
  # Simple JWT validation - no caching, no advanced features
  async def verify_token(authorization: str = Header(None)):
      # Basic token validation and user extraction
      return {"user_id": payload.get("sub"), "email": payload.get("email")}
  ```

- [x] **1.3 Protect Stripe Checkout Only**
  - ‚úÖ Added authentication to `/stripe/checkout` endpoint only
  - ‚úÖ Extract user data from verified JWT (not request body)
  - ‚úÖ **Files modified**: `apps/api/app/routers/stripe.py`
  
  **MVP Code:**
  ```python
  @router.post("/checkout")
  async def create_checkout_session(
      request: CreateCheckoutSessionRequest,
      user: dict = Depends(verify_token)
  ):
      # Use user['user_id'] and user['email'] from JWT
  ```

- [x] **1.4 Frontend JWT Integration**
  - ‚úÖ Updated pricing component to send JWT in Authorization header
  - ‚úÖ Removed user_id/email from request body (comes from JWT now)
  - ‚úÖ Basic 401 error handling
  - ‚úÖ **Files modified**: `apps/web/components/homepage/pricing.tsx`

- [x] **1.5 Basic Environment Setup**
  - ‚úÖ Added Clerk configuration to `apps/api/.env`
  - ‚úÖ Updated `apps/api/app/config.py` with Clerk settings

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- [x] `/stripe/checkout` endpoint requires valid JWT authentication
- [x] Unauthenticated requests return 401 Unauthorized  
- [x] User data extracted from JWT (not request body)
- [x] Frontend successfully sends JWT tokens

---

### 2. Minimal Webhook Handling (MVP)
**Priority**: Critical  
**Risk**: Payments processed but not tracked  
**Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours  
**MVP Scope**: Handle successful payments only, delegate to existing Next.js infrastructure

#### Tasks:
- [x] **2.1 Handle Successful Payments Only**
  - ‚úÖ Implemented `checkout.session.completed` webhook handler
  - ‚úÖ Extract payment data from Stripe webhook
  - ‚úÖ **Files modified**: `apps/api/app/routers/stripe.py:54-107`

- [x] **2.2 Delegate to Next.js API (MVP Strategy)**
  - ‚úÖ Call existing Next.js API routes for database operations
  - ‚úÖ Use internal API calls to `apps/web/api/payments/webhook`
  - ‚úÖ This avoids duplicating database logic for MVP
  
  **MVP Implementation:**
  ```python
  # Call existing Next.js webhook handler
  async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
      await client.post(
          "http://localhost:3000/api/payments/webhook",
          json=webhook_data
      )
  ```

- [x] **2.3 Basic Error Logging**
  - ‚úÖ Log successful webhook processing
  - ‚úÖ Log errors without exposing sensitive data
  - ‚úÖ **Dependencies**: Python `logging` module (built-in)

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- [x] Successful payments trigger webhook processing
- [x] Webhook data passed to Next.js API for database updates
- [x] Basic error logging in place
- [x] No duplicate database logic created

---

### 3. Basic Security (MVP)
**Priority**: Critical  
**Risk**: Information disclosure and basic attack vectors  
**Estimated Time**: 1 hour  
**MVP Scope**: Essential security hardening only

#### Tasks:
- [x] **3.1 Basic Error Handling**
  - ‚úÖ Don't expose stack traces in production
  - ‚úÖ Return generic error messages to clients
  - ‚úÖ **Files modified**: `apps/api/app/routers/stripe.py`
  
  **MVP Implementation:**
  ```python
  try:
      # endpoint logic
  except Exception:
      logger.error("Stripe checkout failed", exc_info=True)
      raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail="Payment processing failed")
  ```

- [x] **3.2 CORS Basic Hardening**
  - ‚úÖ Restrict CORS to localhost:3000 only (for development)
  - ‚úÖ Remove wildcard methods/headers
  - ‚úÖ **Files modified**: `apps/api/main.py:71-77`

- [x] **3.3 Basic Input Validation**
  - ‚úÖ Ensure existing Pydantic models are sufficient
  - ‚úÖ Add basic request size limits
  - ‚úÖ **Files reviewed**: `apps/api/app/models/stripe.py`

#### Acceptance Criteria:
- [x] No stack traces exposed to clients
- [x] CORS restricted to frontend origin
- [x] Basic input validation working

- Comprehensive endpoint testing
- CI/CD integration with GitHub Actions
- Code coverage reporting
- Integration tests for all webhook events

### 5. Complete Database Migration ‚è∏Ô∏è **DEFERRED**
**Why Deferred**: Next.js already handles database operations; no need to duplicate for MVP

  - Test authenticated checkout session creation
  - Test unauthenticated request rejection (401 error)
  - Test invalid JWT token handling

- [ ] **Payment Processing**
  - Complete end-to-end checkout flow with test Stripe keys
  - Verify webhook receives and processes payment events
  - Confirm webhook calls Next.js API successfully

- [ ] **Error Handling**
  - Test various error scenarios (invalid data, network errors)
  - Verify no sensitive information in error responses
  - Test CORS restrictions

#### Testing Tools:
- **curl** for API endpoint testing
- **Stripe CLI** for webhook testing (`stripe listen --forward-to localhost:8001/stripe/webhook`)

### Authentication Decision Summary
**Recommended Approach**: JWT Token Validation with Clerk

**Why JWT over Session Tokens:**
1. **Performance**: No external API calls during authentication
2. **Scalability**: Stateless design works with multiple FastAPI instances  
3. **Reliability**: No dependency on Clerk API availability
4. **Security**: Cryptographically signed tokens with user data embedded
5. **Clerk Native**: Uses Clerk's mature JWT system

**Implementation Strategy:**
- Use Clerk's `getToken()` function in frontend
- Validate JWT signatures using Clerk's public key (JWKS)
- Extract user context from JWT payload (user_id, email, session_id)
- Implement middleware for all protected endpoints
- Add user-based rate limiting using verified user ID

**Alternative Considered**: Session token validation
- **Pros**: Immediate revocation, smaller tokens
- **Cons**: External API dependency, latency, rate limits, network reliability

### Code Review Checklist
- [ ] All critical issues addressed
- [ ] Tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Security review completed
- [ ] Performance impact assessed
